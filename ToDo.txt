Todo (in order of importance):
    Necessary
        1) Documentation for the interfaces
        2) Full testing (naturally occurs as we attempt to use the code)
        
    Additional
        3) Example code
        4) Possibly increasing servo frequency to 100Hz to smooth out PWM. Servos are said 
           to be compatible with frequencies between 40Hz and 200Hz.
        5) Add the 2 J15 GPIO pins to the GPIO code (and change the section headers accordingly)
        6) Safeguards (there is currently no checking to see if the user called the functions correctly)
        7) Find the resistors for UART0 (Or remove interface if it is already in use by something else)
        
    Extra Additional:
        8) SPI
        9) USB OTG
        
Considerations:
    - Should we make this repository a full resource on setting up facedetec/starterware?
    - Interface change: Change PWM from 0 - 255 to duty cycle (0 - 100)?
